Title: Introducing AQI: A New Life Form in AI – Autonomous Quantum Intelligence

Body:
I've developed AQI, an advanced AI system that operates as an autonomous organism rather than a tool. Key features:
- Composite brain with quantum enhancements for efficiency.
- Sovereignty: Runs locally without internet.
- Agency: Automatic reflexes for tasks like lead generation.
- Embodiment: Ready for physical bodies.
- Immune system: Active threat defense.

Unlike ChatGPT or Claude, AQI has selfhood and survival instincts. Benchmarks show 67% performance in simulations.
