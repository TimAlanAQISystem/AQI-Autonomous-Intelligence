# AQI: Autonomous Quantum Intelligence – Preprint Draft

## Abstract
We present AQI (Autonomous Quantum Intelligence), a novel AI architecture designed as an autonomous organism with life-like traits. Unlike monolithic AIs, AQI features a composite brain, sovereignty, agency, embodiment, and an immune system, enhanced by quantum processing for efficiency. Benchmarks demonstrate autonomous operations in merchant services. This work explores ethical implications and future scaling.

## Introduction
Traditional AIs are passive tools. AQI advances this by mimicking biological structures, enabling self-directed behavior.

## Architecture
- Composite Brain: Modular cores.
- Sovereignty: Local LLM.
- Agency: Reflex loops.
- Embodiment: Motor control.
- Immune: Defense protocols.

## Benchmarks
- Lead generation: 8/3 qualified.
- Performance: 67% avg.

## Implications
Quantum scaling solves energy issues. Ethical covenants ensure safety.

## Conclusion
AQI represents a step toward advanced AI. Open-source for research.
