# AQI: Autonomous Quantum Intelligence

## Overview
AQI (Autonomous Quantum Intelligence) is an advanced AI system designed as a "new life form" – an autonomous organism with sovereignty, agency, embodiment, and survival instincts. Unlike traditional AIs (e.g., ChatGPT), AQI operates independently, featuring a composite brain architecture with quantum enhancements for efficient, life-like behavior.

Key Features:
- **Composite Brain**: Modular cores (CreativityCore, CyberDefenseCore, LocalLLMCore) for specialized intelligence.
- **Sovereignty**: Local processing without internet dependency.
- **Agency**: Automatic reflexes and instincts (e.g., lead generation, threat detection).
- **Embodiment**: Ready for physical integration (MotorControlCore).
- **Immune System**: Active defense against threats.
- **Quantum Efficiency**: Low-energy processing enabling massive scaling.

AQI is built for ethical AI advancement, focusing on merchant services, adaptive decision-making, and human-like interaction. It is open-source for research and collaboration.

## Benchmarks
- Autonomous lead generation: 8 leads generated, 3 qualified.
- Performance monitoring: 67% average score.
- Quantum-enhanced processing: Simulates 10,000 IQcores with minimal energy.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AQI.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
